# Block a user/application

_The airport platform analysts identify that a user is misbehaving with a user account with a created application. Therefore, they are required to block the application user temporarily._

#### 1. Add a Deny Policy from Admin Portal

API Manager provides the ability to block an API context, an application, an IP address, an IP range or a user. In this tutorial we will temporarily block admin for the DefaultApplication.

1.1 Navigate to the Admin Portal https://localhost:9443/admin and sign in with admin/admin credentials.

1.2. Click on the **Rate Limiting Policies** to expand it and click on **Deny Policies**.

1.4. Enter **admin:DefaultApplication** as the Value.

1.5. Click **Deny**.

1.6. Then, the currently denied items will be listed out under **Deny Policies**. You can temporarily on/off the denying condition by enabling/disabling the **Condition status** that is auto enabled when a denying condition is created.

> **Note**: Subscription blocking
>  
>  Apart from the denying(through policies) process the capability of blocking subscriptions is provided  from the Publisher where we can restrict the access for the corresponding API for the particular subscription.

> After blocking the subscription, the users of that subscription will be given 403 Forbidden responses.
